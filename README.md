This is a personal project aimed at gaining knowledge of Active Directory and emulating real-world tasks through an IT Help Desk/Service Desk position. 
Credits to Josh Madakor for making a tutorial video helping set up Active Directory using virtual machines. https://youtu.be/MHsI8hJmggI?si=_xakUNLCsHSqyDe0
